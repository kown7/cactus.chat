Cactus Comments is developed in the open by volunteers.

If you would like to talk to us, please join us in the [Cactus Comments matrix
room](https://matrix.to/#/#cactus:bordum.dk)!

We also communicate on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments). This is
where you can file bugs and feature requests and also where you can
[contribute](../contribute).

We want to make Cactus Comments a welcoming community. [Be nice](../coc) :)
