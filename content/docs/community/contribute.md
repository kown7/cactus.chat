All our repositories live in our [GitLab
organisation](https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments). There are three repositories
you might want to contribute to:
[cactus-client](https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-client) which is all
the code for the frontend of Cactus Comments,
[cactus-appservice](https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus-appservice) which
is all the code for the backend application service and
[cactus.chat](https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments/cactus.chat) which contains
all the code for [https://cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat) (this site).

The individual repositories should explain how to contribute in their
`README.md` or `HACKING.md`. All repositories accepts merge requests using
GitLab ticketing system.

Remember that you can [come talk to us](../community/) if you would like.
