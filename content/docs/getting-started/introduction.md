The easiest way to try Cactus Comments out is following our [quick start
guide](../quick-start). You can do it locally on a completely static site. If
you already have a website running on WordPress, Hugo or something else
entirely, check [the integrations page](../integrations) to see if we got you
covered. If you run your own Matrix server, you can [self-host Cactus
Comments](../../self-hosting/howto). We would love it, if you [engaged with the
community](../../community/community) or otherwise
[contributed](../../community/contribute). ðŸ’•.
