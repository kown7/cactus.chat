If you are using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) to generate your website,
[this script](https://github.com/pieterdavid/nikola-cactus-comments) can help
to replace the comments system in your template by Cactus Comments
(it should work for most themes that embed comments in the same way as the default themes).
The [README](https://github.com/pieterdavid/nikola-cactus-comments#readme)
explains how to run the script and pass additional configuration options
(home server, site name, etc.) for Cactus Comments to Nikola.
